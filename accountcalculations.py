def calcBudget():
    # to caluculate budget we need to do this equation:
    # totalIncome - totalFixedExpenses - totalVariableExpenses - savings
    # the total income, expenses, and savings information will have to be put in by the user on the dashboard page.
    # it is just a matter of collecting that information and displaying it.
